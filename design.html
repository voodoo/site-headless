      <h1>The state of modern electric guitars</h1>
      
      <p>If you go to your local guitar chain, you will find an infinite variety of guitars to choose from</p>
      
      <p>But, other than their shapes, electric guitars have not changed much over the last 75 years</p>
      
      <p>Headless guitars have arrived on the scene, and despite the fact they don&#39;t look like a traditional guitar, they are begining to be popular - and not just in niche markets</p>
      
      <p>There are many good reasons for this</p>
      
      <ul>
      <li><p><strong>Physics</strong> 
      When the scale of the guitar is composed entirely of the strings (not over the nut to the head or down a string through for example) you get better resonation and sustain</p></li>
      <li><p><strong>Ergonomics</strong>
      When the guitar fits the shape of the player and how it is played. Historically guitars were made to set mostly parallel to the ground - it turns out more of an angle, closer to 45 degrees is better.</p></li>
      <li><p><strong>Weight</strong>
      Typically, headless guitars are lighter - partly out of ergonomics and partly because they are more compact. Allan Holdsworth said it well, &quot;leave out the parts you don&#39;t need&quot;</p></li>
      </ul>
      
      <!-- > If you had asked a rockstar what the needed the would have said more head -->
      
      <h2>The Wood</h2>
      
      <p>There has been endless controversy regarding the wood of the guitar and how it impacts tone. Here is my take. It has no impact. It is an &#39;electric&#39; guitar not a &#39;wood&#39; guitar. IE the resonation you&#39;d get from a dense piece of wood is about the same as what you would get from one made from acrylic of the same density. What matters is how well the guitar holds strings at a certain tension - and the electronics</p>
      
      <p>The best looking guitars, IMO, are wood however. Beautiful, luscious, increasingly scarce wood</p>
      
      <p>In regards to the design of a guitar, I like to use both wood (for aesthetics) and synthetic material for strength, stability and cost</p>
      
      <h2>The modern luther-tailor <small class='text-muted'>The modern guitar builder could benefit from studying a good tailor</small></h2>
      
      <p>A good tailor takes into consideration many factors.
      Long arms or short arms? Formal or casual? Long sleeves or short? Cotton or hemp?
      Plaid or plain?</p>

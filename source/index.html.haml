%ul
  %li Got my first guitar, way too late in life, for my birthday in June of 2012
  %li Have been kind of infatuated by them since
  %li The magnetics and electronics are fascinating
  %li Guitars are a perfect blend of form and function
  %li Hard to imagine a more expressive instrument


%h1
  Why
  %small.text-muted
    for fun and relaxation
%ul
  %li To learn - by screwing up
  %li To explore - by trying new things
  %li There are no luthier schools around here
  %li So I've been ripping up perfectly good ones to see how they tick
  %li I've screwed up a few guitars but I've learned a lot

%ul
  %li
    With almost every guitar I've ever seen - I wanted to remove something
    %ul
      %li Paint
      %li Pickguard
      %li Size
  %li Seldom have I wanted to add something
  %li Even with the most resplendent paint jobs, I wonder what the wood would look like

  Quality
  %small.text-muted
    what I've learned about 'quality'
%ul
  %li
    There is no
    %em best
    guitar - only different guitars in different price ranges
  %li 90% of guitars are about 90% the same
  %li The top 5% guitars cost 10 to 20 times as much
  %li Of that 5%, 90% is subjective with few objective differentiations
  %li There has been very little innovation over the last 50 years, at least in terms of guitars with magnetic pickups

      %li Headless guitars scream 'modern' to me
      %li
        I
        %strong like
        the look without the head
      %li Having the tuners on the body makes more sense to me
%p
  %strong My perfect guitar will borrow from all of these

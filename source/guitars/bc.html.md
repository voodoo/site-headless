# BC Rich <small> aka  "off with your head"</small>

I'm not the biggest fan of this style of body shape but I picked this up for less than 100 bucks. I would have paid that for the Floyd Rose speed-loading bridge which I have been looking for and am intrigued by.

The tuners reside on the bridge - but not in the way a Steinberger works. The strings are first tuned with an allen wrench - from then on with the fine tuners. 

__Importantly, no big tuning keys to take up space.__

That is why the head does not have tuners - and seems odd. It is just there because BC Rich refuses to move into the modern era. Maybe people don't want them. I do.

And that is why this setup makes the perfect headless guitar.

In my view the future is headless.

* Headless
* Speed loader - the head is a prop
* Body is mahogony - nice wood actually
* Smaller size ~7/8
* Use a tremol-no so you can float/lock


### Design

* Less agressive - fewer sharp edges/points
* Women's hip
* Feather
* Use the head as a hanger for git

# First Pass

# Yellow brings out the wood best - and barely shows up as 'yellow'

# Red . . .

# . . . plus blue equals purple

# Smooth

* The feather is cool

# Not a bad looking headless

I had to shim the neck, I guess since I sanded it, so I could get the action I wanted. Also, I had to use some, 'set screws' because the longer screws into the neck had gotten stripped. Lucky I had them around. All in all the neck profile / action turned out pretty good.

I'm absolutely sold on the Floyd Rose speedloader and strings. Taking off the strings, and bridge was cake - I did it multiple times. When I put it back together it was __still__ in tune. Very nice design I hope they can manage to make the strings :(

Wired straight to the jack. Sounds good!


# Mistakes so far

* Cut the head off __entirely__. 
  * Leave some next time for:
    * hanging
    * tuner
* Jack - almost ruined it when I made the body curved there (too shallow)
  * Curve does not matter (for leg rest) - since that is where the jack is
  * Need a different jack plate


# Up next

* Wiring the switch/tone/volume
* Changing out the pots and cap
* Kill switch?


## Cons

* [Getting the strings](http://www.floydrose.com/news/speedloader-update-october-2014)

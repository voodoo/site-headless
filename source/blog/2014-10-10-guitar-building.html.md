subtitle: Guitar projects are fun but I'm not a craftsman

I like the 'idea' of building a guitar but I'm not a luthier or even craftsman. I'm more likely to lose a limb than build a quality guitar from scratch.

But I am beginning to know what I like. Pulling a part a guitar and building it back up, in some ways, has help me appreciate what a guitar is and why it is put together the way it is.

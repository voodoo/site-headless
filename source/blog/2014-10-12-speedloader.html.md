subtitle: The speedloader is a nice evolution

The Floyd Rose tremolos have been a bit of a mystery to me. Using the whammy bar was cool - but not worth the overhead. It was hard to tune,  hard to string.

Recently I reassesed the FRT - taking the opportunity to take it for a spin while I was testing a new Railhammer pickup on a Kramer. I put some 10-52 strings  - necesitating setting up the trem from scratch. I have to say the second pass at using one went better (the big strings will take some getting used to).

Then I remembered I bought a BC Rich (for $85) with a FRT speedloader. I've really learned to like this tremolo. The double bullet strings really solve some problems with the original. The way it is tuned, with the general tuning being done with an allen wrench on the bridge AND the fine tuners is like a breath of fresh air. This negates the need for having traditional, large, bulky tuners - on either end of the guitar. All tuning being on the bridge is a great innovation IMO. It allows for headless designs.

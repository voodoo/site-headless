I like the 'idea' of building a guitar but I'm not a luthier and far from being a craftsman. I'm more likely to lose a limb than build a quality guitar from scratch.

But I am beginning to know what I like. Pulling a part a guitar and building it back up, in some ways, has helped me appreciate what a guitar is and why it is put together the way it is.

# BC Rich <small> aka  "off with your head"</small>

I'm not the biggest fan of this style of body shape but I picked this up for less than 100 bucks. I would have paid that for the Floyd Rose speed-loading bridge which I have been looking for and am intrigued by.

The tuners reside on the bridge - but not in the way a Steinberger works. The strings are first tuned with an allen wrench - from then on with the fine tuners. 

__Importantly, no big tuning keys to take up space.__

That is why the head does not have tuners - and seems odd. It is just there because BC Rich refuses to move into the modern era. Maybe people don't want them. I do.

And that is why this setup makes the perfect headless guitar.

In my view the future is headless.

* Headless
* Speed loader - the head is a prop
* Body is mahogony - nice wood actually
* Smaller size ~7/8
* Use a tremol-no so you can float/lock

### Design

* Less agressive - fewer sharp edges/points
* Women's hip
* Feather
* Use the head as a hanger for git
